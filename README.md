# ExampleMod

An opinionated Minecraft Forge 1.8.9 example mod. 

This repository is not a vanilla Forge example. It intentionally deviates from common 1.8.9 practices to demonstrate a cleaner, more scalable approach to mod architecture.

## Included Tooling
- [**Spotless**](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) - deterministic code formatting
- [**Blossom**](https://github.com/KyoriPowered/blossom) - compile time source templating and build constants
- **GitHub Actions** - automated formatting checks and build validation
